# kould

Could you tell me which kernel modules or device drivers are currently running on your machine?

One of the most common challenges when contributing to the Linux kernel is figuring out where to start. Many Linux kernel contributors enjoy exploring the device drivers currently active on their own machines.  
Just Do It: `$ sudo python3 kould.py`

This program helps you identify which Linux kernel modules or device drivers are currently loaded on your machine.  

Ready to add `printk()` to the modules you want and monitor the kernel messages?  

Happy hacking!
